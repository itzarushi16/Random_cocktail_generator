🍹 Random Cocktail Generator - README
Welcome to the Random Cocktail Generator project! This project is a fun web-based app that generates a random cocktail recipe when you click the "Generate Cocktail" button. The app fetches data from TheCocktailDB API and displays the cocktail's image, ingredients, category, glass type, and preparation instructions.

📂 Project Structure
The project is organized into three core files:

index.html – Contains the structure and layout of the web page.
style.css – Handles the styling, including the layout, colors, fonts, and responsive design.
